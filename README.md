# Sonam_Library_Management_Data_Analysis

🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and analyzing a relational library management database to support efficient data storage, retrieval, and reporting. The system was built to manage core library operations such as book inventory, borrower information, and transaction tracking. The project demonstrates strong skills in database design, data modeling, SQL querying, and data validation.

The database was designed to ensure data integrity, scalability, and optimized query performance for analytical and operational use cases.

🎯 Objectives

Design and implement a structured relational database for library management.

Model relationships between entities such as books, borrowers, publishers, and library branches.

Perform data import, validation, and querying to generate insights.

Ensure data consistency through constraints and normalization.

Handle real-world data and troubleshoot common SQL errors.

🗂️ Database Schema & Entities

The database consists of the following tables:

Publisher

Borrower

Books

Authors

Book Copies

Book Loans

Library Branch

These tables were structured to capture the complete lifecycle of book inventory and borrowing operations.

🛠️ Key Contributions
🔹 Database Design & Data Modeling

Designed relational database schema using Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling techniques.

Established relationships between tables using primary and foreign keys.

Ensured data normalization to reduce redundancy and improve data consistency.

🔹 Table Creation & Constraints

Created tables with appropriate data types, constraints, and indexing strategies.

Implemented primary keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints.

Applied auto-increment properties to primary keys for efficient record management.

🔹 Data Import & Validation

Imported structured data files to populate database tables.

Ensured alignment between file schema and table structure during data ingestion.

Validated data quality and resolved inconsistencies.

🔹 SQL Querying & Data Retrieval

Developed SQL queries to retrieve, filter, and analyze data based on specific business requirements.

Generated insights related to borrower activity, book availability, and library usage patterns.

🔹 Error Handling & Debugging

Diagnosed and resolved common SQL errors, including error codes 1292 (incorrect date format) and 1140 (grouping and aggregation issues).

Corrected date format mismatches and improved query reliability.
